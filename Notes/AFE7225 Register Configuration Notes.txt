Important Registers

5.3 Chip Control Registers

CONFIG107 has SOFTWARE_RESET bit for whole device, including this register
0x000, set value 0x02
Causes reset to occur

CONFIG111 has LVDS mode and SDOUT mode configuration
0x20A, set value 0x0E
REG_LVDS_TX = 1
REG_LVDS_RX = 1
WHAT_IS_SDOUT<1:0> = 10

5.5 Clocking Control Registers

CONFIG117A and CONFIG117B have control of duty cycle correction on ADC channels
Since ADC_CLK is >65MSps, these bits should be set
0x0DB, set value 0x01
0x0F2, set value 0x08

5.7 LVDS Tx Input Interface Registers

CONFIG125 has data mode and format options for Tx DAC input
0x30B, set value 0x80
TWOWIRE_TX = 1

CONFIG126 has override control and data encoding options
0x30C, set value 0x04
MASTER_OVERRIDE_TX = 1

5.8 LVDS Rx Output Interface Registers

CONFIG128 has output stream modification for Rx ADC output
0x337, not going to be set, yet

CONFIG131 has override control and data encoding options
0x33A, set value 0x82
MASTER_OVERRIDE_RX = 1
TWOWIRE_RX = 1

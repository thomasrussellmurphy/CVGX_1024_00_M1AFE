Important Registers

5.1 Transmit Digital Signal Chain Registers

CONFIG0 has DAC powerdown settings
0x103, set value 0x1F
Causes whole transmit chain to power down
0x103, set value 0x00
Power up whole transmit chain and keep FIFO enabled

CONFIG2 has digital loopback control
0x105, set value 0x02
Activates digital loopback mode from ADC, requires DAC_DCLKIN to be active

5.2 Receive Digital Signal Chain Registers

CONFIG61 has decimation filter enable and loopback enable
0x165, set value 0xC0
Activates analog loopback mode from DAC

CONFIG63 has ADC powerdown settings
0x167, set value 0x1F
Causes whole receive chain to power down
0x167, set value 0x1E
Causes only the channels A and B to power down, outputting mid-code
0x167, set value 0x00
Power up whole receive chain

5.3 Chip Control Registers

CONFIG107 has SOFTWARE_RESET bit for whole device, including this register
0x000, set value 0x02
Causes reset to occur

CONFIG111 has LVDS mode and SDOUT mode configuration
0x20A, set value 0x0E
REG_LVDS_TX = 1
REG_LVDS_RX = 1
WHAT_IS_SDOUT<1:0> = 10

5.5 Clocking Control Registers

CONFIG117A and CONFIG117B have control of duty cycle correction on ADC channels
Since ADC_CLK is >65MSps, these bits should be set
0x0DB, set value 0x01
0x0F2, set value 0x08

5.7 LVDS Tx Input Interface Registers

CONFIG125 has data mode and format options for Tx DAC input
0x30B, set value 0x80
TWOWIRE_TX = 1

CONFIG126 has override control and data encoding options
0x30C, set value 0x04
MASTER_OVERRIDE_TX = 1

5.8 LVDS Rx Output Interface Registers

CONFIG128 has output stream modification for Rx ADC output
0x337, set value 0x00
Sets no output pattern, normal operation
0x337, set value 0x07
Sets sync-check pattern: 111000111000 in 2-wire mode

CONFIG131 has override control and data encoding options
0x33A, set value 0x82
MASTER_OVERRIDE_RX = 1
TWOWIRE_RX = 1
